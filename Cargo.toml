extended-description="""\
Monitors & collects system resource utilization on Linux for Docker containers and Kubernetes pods
with fine granularity and low overhead, emitting resource utilization logs in CSVY (csv + yaml) format.
Originally, developed in Rust as a custom tool to help detect and analyze millibottlenecks in containerized online systems,
rAdvisor runs by polling the target provider (either the local Docker daemon or the Kubernetes API server)
every 1 second to get a list of active, running containers/pods.
From this list, rAdvisor runs a collection thread every 50ms to get resource utilization data for each active target using Linux cgroups,
outputting the resultant logs in /var/log/radvisor/stats."""

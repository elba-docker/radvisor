% RADVISOR(1) Version 1.1.4 | radvisor User Manual

NAME
====

**radvisor run** - runs radvisor to collect statistics for a updating set of targets

SYNOPSIS
========

> radvisor run \[FLAGS\] \[OPTIONS\] \<provider\>

DESCRIPTION
===========

**radvisor run** runs a collection thread that writes resource statistics to
output CSV files using configurable intervals. It has two modes of operation (providers):

1. **docker** - Collects statistics for containers, polling the docker daemon to get a list of active running containers (every 1s by default)
and using their cgroups to read information on their system resource utilization.
*Likely needs to be run as root*.
2. **kubernetes** - Collects statistics for Kubernetes pods, polling the Kubernetes API server to get a list of all active running pods
that have been scheduled on the current machine's node, using the cgroups for each pod.
*Needs to be a part of an active cluster and needs to be able to find the Kubernetes config file*.
